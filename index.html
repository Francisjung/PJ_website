          For the past three decades, I have pursued the study of history as a researcher, author, and university instructor. Currently, I serve as a professor of history and anthropology at the Milwaukee School of Engineering in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.<br><br>

I have a wide range of interests: American history, art history, North American Indian cultures, the history of the Midwest, the Second World Warâ€¦the list goes on.<br><br>

More than anything, I enjoy sharing my interests with the general public. So much of what we read and hear about the dramatic story of the human past is superficial and shallow. I enjoy engaging in topics that are deep, thoughtful, and at times unsettling.<br><br>

Please look through my webpage to see the kinds of research I have done and the topics on which I like to speak. Contact me if you are interested in booking me for a talk for your historical society or civic organization.<br><br>

I am also an experienced historical researcher who enjoys working as a consultant. Let me know if you have an opportunity we can pursue together.<br><br>

Visit the link to my publications if you are interested in any of the books or articles I have written. The articles can be downloaded at no cost.<br><br>

My contact information is below, I look forward to hearing from you!<br><br>
